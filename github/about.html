				<p> W3Schools is a famous web site for learning web technologies online.[1] Content includes tutorials and references relating to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, PHP, Python, AngularJS, SQL, Bootstrap, Node.js, jQuery, XQuery, AJAX, and XML.
				</p>
				<p>Created in 1998, its name is derived from the World Wide Web, but is not affiliated with the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium).[2] It is run by Refsnes Data in Norway.[1] W3Schools presents thousands of code examples. By using the TryIt editor, readers can edit examples and execute the code in a sandbox.
				</p>
				<h1 class="page-title">Tutorials point</h1>
				<p>Over time, policies and guidelines have developed which reflect the experience of thousands of editors who are constantly learning and refining how to create balanced, well-sourced, informative articles, and how to work with others and resolve conflict when it arises. These rules are principles, not laws, on Wikipedia. Policies and guidelines exist only as rough approximations of their underlying principles. They are not intended to provide an exact or complete definition of the principles in all circumstances. They must be understood in context, using some sense and discretion. Nevertheless there are certain things that Wikipedia is not and common mistakes that should be avoided. The five pillars is a popular summary of the most pertinent Wikipedia principles.

				<h1 class="page-title">Geeks for geeks</h1>
				<p>Geek.com was founded in 1996 by Joel Evans and Rob Hughes. Joel's brother, Sam Evans, was soon added as the site's chief editor.[2] The site was founded as the Ugeek newsletter but soon become a larger online portal with multiple different sections, including JobGeek, GameGeek, PDAGeek, and ChipGeek.[3] Among the site's many early successes was Ugeek.com's popular Processor Archive.[4]
				</p>
				<p>In March 2007 Geek.com was sold to NameMedia, a company that specializes in domain name reselling and parking. NameMedia had recently acquired Philip Greenspun's photo.net and was building out its Enthusiast Media Network, where Geek.com would be the lead technology site. After the acquisition Rob Hughes and Sam Evans left the site, though co-founder Joel Evans stayed on in his role as Chief Geek. Soon afterwards the site's mobile analyst Matthew "palmsolo" Miller left the site and started writing at ZDnet's Mobile Gadgeteer blog.
